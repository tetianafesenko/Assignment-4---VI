    "Mathematically, it can be expressed as: z = w * x + b\n",
    " - Each neuron in the input layer receives an input value denoted as \"x\", which could be a set of numbers.\n",
    " - This input value \"x\" is multiplied by a weight \"w\" and added to a bias \"b\"\n",
    " - The result of this multiplication and addition is the weighted sum\"z\"\n"

    "A CNN (convolutional neural network) is a type of neural network designed to process grid-like data. Ex: images. It uses special layers called convolutional layers to automatically learn patterns or features from the data. \n",

    "The main differences between CNN and FFNN are that CNN have convolutional layers for capturing local patterns, using local connectivity and parameter sharing for efficient learning, and often incorporate pooling layers for downsampling. Overall, CNNs are specialized more for image-like data processing.\n"
